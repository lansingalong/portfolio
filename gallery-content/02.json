    "description": "These two were part of a design a spread project. I designed a guide that would help people understand the different types of wild plants for foraging. The guide starts from places like your lawn and travel to places like the woods and forests. <br><br>For the second one, I designed a two-page spread that highlights Jiufen, a tourist attraction in the mountains of Keelang, Taiwan. I had the incredible opportunity to visit this mine town in 2015 and understood why Hayao Miyazaki used this as a model for the hit film, Spirited Away. I wanted to capture the liveliness and beauty of this town while combining illustration, typography for the reader to engage in a visually-fun experience as they flip through this magazine.",
