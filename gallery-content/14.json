I use video tutorials such as those on lynda.com, greyscalegorilla, and YouTube. By the end of 6 months, ideally I will have a strong grasp of basic animation techniques and motions as explained by <a href=\"http://www.frankanollie.com/PhysicalAnimation.html\" target=\"_blank\">Frank and Ollie.</a>",
