	"description": "The Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) is a federally-funded non-profit outreach program that offers nutrition education to limited-resource families and children in all 50 states and U.S. territories. <br><br> I started designing for EFNEP in February 2016, and my first big project was conceptualizing and developing a brand identity for their annual conference held in April. I consistently focused on developing a guideline through the different programs and classes they would have at the conference, and worked directly with the program coordinators. <br><br> In late June, I worked with the program coordinators to rebrand EFNEP’s program, focusing on EFNEP’s four core areas: diet quality, food resource management, household food safety, and food security. My focus was to have a cohesion across all platforms including websites, social media, and print while telling EFNEP’s story in a visual way.",
