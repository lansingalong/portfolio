    "description": "I designed a two-page spread that highlights Jiufen, a tourist attraction in the mountains of Keelang, Taiwan. I had the incredible opportunity to visit this mine town in 2015 and understood why Hayao Miyazaki used this as a model for the hit film, Spirited Away. I wanted to capture the liveliness and beauty of this town while combining illustration, typography for the reader to engage in a visually-fun experience as they flip through this magazine.",
