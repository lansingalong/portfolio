    "description": "Celia Paradise is an imaginative fashion brand for consumers in their early twenties to late thirties. Many fashion items contain bright, colorful and geometric shaped patterns that are eye-catching. Logomark is inspired by the six-wired bird of paradise, and expanded branding are bright, geometric branches, and a tree that serves as a context for the environment of the bird logomark. Yellow base and other bright colors were chosen for a fun and tropical look. <br><br>I researched fashion items that are appealing for the target audience, engaged in environmental research about the look and feel of the boutique and expanded store themes, and created a cohesive color palette for the brand. I also designed an expanded and simple version of the logomark for use in various scenarios such as print and digital.",
